# SPM-Code-Complexity-Measurement-Tool
Measurement of code complexity due to size, type of control structures, nesting of control structures, inheritance and recursion

This tool will measure code complexity in Java and C++ code due to the following factors :

1. Size
2. Type and the nesting level of control structures
3. Inheritance
4. Recursion

This project will consists of a Java Desktop Application which will measure code complexity and save the calculated values and metadata to the database.
